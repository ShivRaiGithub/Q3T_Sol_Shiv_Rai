# WBA Turbin3 Q3 Builders Cohort

Welcome to my repository for the WBA Turbin3 Q3 Builders cohort! This repo contains various projects and programs that I completed during the cohort. The repository is organized into four main folders: `Anchor`, `Basics`, `blink-choose-starter`, and `capstone_nft_grounds`.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **Anchor**
This folder contains several Solana programs written using the Anchor framework. The programs included are:

- **Amm**: An Automated Market Maker (AMM) that facilitates the exchange of tokens in a decentralized manner.
- **Dice_game**: A game where the randomness of a dice roll is determined using the player's signature.
- **Marketplace**: A platform for buying and selling NFTs.
- **MetaStake**: A staking program where NFTs can be staked using Metaplex core.
- **nft_stake**: A program for staking NFTs.
- **Vault**: A vault program where users can deposit and withdraw tokens.

### 2. **Basics**
This folder contains TypeScript files that provide foundational knowledge and practical examples related to working with Solana's Vaults and the SPL (Solana Program Library). The files in this folder explore various concepts such as creating and interacting with vaults and managing SPL tokens.

### 3. **blink-choose-starter**
This project is a Blink and Actions-based application that allows users to mint an NFT based on their choice. The project showcases the use of Solana Blinks and Actions to create an interactive and dynamic NFT minting experience.

### 4. **capstone_nft_grounds**
This folder contains my capstone project for the WBA Turbin3 Q3 Builders cohort. The project allows an admin to initialize a marketplace and nft competition. Users can stake their nfts in the competition, vote on them, earn rewards in form of points and use those points as the currency of marketplace to buy the NFTs listed.
